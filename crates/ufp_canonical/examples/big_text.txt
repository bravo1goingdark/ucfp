    In 2025, the Universal Content Fingerprint (UCFP) project aims to create a
    truly global standard for identifying and linking *any* digital content.
    
    From simple text snippets — like this one — to complex multi-modal data
    (videos, images, PDFs, and more), the system will extract canonical,
    perceptual, structural, and semantic fingerprints.

    Why? Because duplication, plagiarism, and untracked reuse have become
    universal problems — especially in AI training data. By providing a
    language-agnostic, deterministic pipeline for fingerprinting, UCFP makes
    it possible to know when two pieces of content *mean* the same thing,
    even if they look different.

    The prototype includes:
        - Canonicalizer: normalizes Unicode, whitespace, and case.
        - Perceptual layer: shingles, winnows, and hashes text regions.
        - RocksDB-based index: stores token-to-document mappings.
        - Matching service: retrieves and ranks similar documents.
    
    Developers can use the Rust crate directly, or call the REST/gRPC APIs
    from Python, Node.js, Go, or Java bindings.
